# Projects
This repository contains all the python projects that I have developed. The most noted out of the bunch is the OpenCV Face Recognistion code. I have also built basic game applications like Madlibs,Tic-Tak-Toe with Ai,and many more.

Purpose
The OpenCV face recognition project in Python aims to detect faces in images and videos and recognize them by matching them against known faces in a database. It accomplishes this goal by using computer vision techniques to extract facial features, such as eye and nose position and shape, and then comparing these features to a database of known faces.

Functionality
The project offers the following functionality:

Detection of faces in images and videos
Recognition of faces by comparing them to a database of known faces
Creation of a database of known faces
Real-time face detection and recognition from a video stream
